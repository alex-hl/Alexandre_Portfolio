## Python Project: An Experiment to Compare Algorithms for Parcel Delivery

In this project I have made the use a of a random algorithm and a greedy algorithm to schedule a truck route for parcels delivery. The goal was to analyze which algorithm was most efficient in mapping the truck's route. Some highlights of the steps taken are:
* Using hash tables in order to create a distance map
* Modeling a domain to implement necessary classes
* Implementing the algorithms

## Python Project: Automated Puzzle Solving

In this project I have implemented breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms to solve logic puzzles. The algorithms were able to solve sodkus, word ladder, and expression tree puzzle. Some highlights of the steps taken are:
* Implement clases for the bfs and dfs solver
* Implement classes for each puzzles which specifies conditions on how to be solved

## Data Analysis in R: Analyzing Volatility of foreign exchanges (EUR/CAD and USD/CAD)

The goal of this analysis is to explore degrees of uncertainty for Canadian foreign exchange rates using
bootstrap sampling Distribution of Variances. Performed for the EUR/CAD and USD/CAD exchange rates.
